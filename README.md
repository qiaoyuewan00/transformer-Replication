# Transformer Replication

This project is a faithful replication of the Transformer model introduced in the paper **"Attention is All You Need"** by Vaswani et al. The goal is to deepen understanding of the Transformer architecture and provide a clean, modular codebase for further experimentation and extension.

## 📖 Overview

Transformer is a groundbreaking model in natural language processing that relies entirely on self-attention mechanisms, allowing for parallel computation and long-range dependency modeling. This repository includes an end-to-end implementation from data processing to training and evaluation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/qiaoyuewan00/transformer-Replication.git
cd transformer-Replication
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you're using Python 3.8+ and install required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If requirements.txt is not available, install key dependencies manually:
```
pip install torch numpy tqdm
```
### 3. Train the Model
```
python train.py
```
### 4. Evaluate the Model
```
python evaluate.py
```
🧠 Features
Full Transformer Replication
Includes all key components: multi-head attention, feed-forward layers, residual connections, layer normalization, and positional encoding.

Modular Design
Each module is independently implemented for clarity and reusability.

Educational Focus
The codebase is well-commented and structured for beginners and researchers looking to understand Transformer internals.

📈 Example Results
After training on a toy dataset (e.g., sequence-to-sequence synthetic data), the model successfully learns meaningful input-output mappings, demonstrating the validity of the architecture.

🔭 Future Work
Implement variations such as BERT and GPT.

Integrate visualization tools (e.g., attention maps).

Support multilingual and multitask training.

Add inference and deployment examples.
